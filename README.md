**A simple,straightforward and effective way to password-protect applications on Windows.**

Windows does not natively support password protection for individual applications or files. While you can encrypt files using built-in tools like EFS or third-party software, applying passwords to programs typically requires third-party solutions. These solutions often involve system-level modifications or hooks that can impact system performance and security

**App Shield offers a straightforward workaround:**

Instead of directly launching protected applications, users launch App Shield, which acts as a password gate. Upon successful authentication, App Shield then launches the actual application. Using this approach, you can add protection to multiple programs, files, and directories without worrying about performance impact or system instability, as the app only runs when you attempt to launch a protected item.
